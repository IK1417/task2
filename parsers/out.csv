Liberal senator Andrew Bragg coauthored a landmark Senate Select Committee report into digital asset regulation last year, investigating issues such as regulation and consumer protection, the fintech terror of “debanking”, and the taxation of digital assets, setting our a legislative roadmap with 12 recommendations that were embraced by the former Coalition government. Speaking to Startup Daily on ausbiz today, Senator Bragg said assistant treasurer Stephen Jones and his boss, Jim Chalmers, need to act before Australia misses out on the opportunity digital assets offer. Treasurer Jim Chalmers said “the first step in a reform agenda” for crypto will see Treasury prioritise ‘token mapping’ work for the remainder of this year to help identify how crypto assets and related services should be regulated. Chalmers said the Treasury work would identify notable gaps in the regulatory framework, progress work on a licensing framework, review innovative organisational structures, look at custody obligations for third party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards. A public consultation paper on token mapping will be released soon. But much of that groundwork was already laid out in the Bragg report and subsequent Treasury consultation, although Chalmers accused the former government of prematurely jumping “straight to options without first understanding what was being regulated”. Senator Bragg, now in opposition, said the government is trying to create the impression that it is doing something when it’s not. “Australia is in the midst of a race for consumer protection, capital attraction and innovation. The Albanese government is commissioning another review rather than responding to the Treasury consultation on crypto markets and custody,” he said. “The Government should get on with the job of producing a draft bill rather than further reviewing. Our competitors are enhancing their regulatory systems while we establish endless reviews.” Here’s the interview:  https://assets.ausbiz.live/assets/5094a091-6d0d-4501-b905-78f07013a454/MP4/vimondio_video_1920x1080_10000.mp4   You can turn into the Startup Daily show Monday to Thursday from 2-2.40pm on ausbiz.com.au, for the latest news in tech and startups.

NSW Minister for Science, Innovation and Technology Alister Henskens said government investment is designed to turbocharge the innovation ecosystem in NSW, creating jobs and new industries in line with the recently released NSW 20-Year R&D Roadmap. The Budget included $703.4 million to establish the Future Economy Fund, which will expand and accelerate R&D and commercialisation opportunities across the State, building on the work of the NSW Government’s R&D Action Plan. The $270m is for two new facilities – the Sydney Biomedical Accelerator Complex in Camperdown and the Viral Vector manufacturing facility at Westmead – to help develop treatments for rare, life-limiting diseases as part of the NSW Government’s commitment to driving world-leading health and research precincts. Startup Daily TV caught up with Minister Henskens to talk about the government’s plans, including addressing the “valley of death” for capital for early-stage startups, looking two decades ahead in deep tech, the potential for quantum computing and the new announcement this week, plans for the Semiconductor Sector Service Bureau (S3B) to ramp the state’s semiconductor capability in partnership with the CSIRO.

The ground-breaking technology has been called RealBrain, developed by a team of neuroscientists and biomaterials experts. Because the highly reproducible neural micro-tissues are designed to mimic the physiology of the human brain it solves one of the pharmaceutical industry’s biggest problems: finding a more physiologically relevant alternative to in vitro and animal models. The company is already producing its minimum viable product (MVP) and has shared the platform for evaluation by leading drug discovery companies and prospective commercial partners around the world, with the goal of a fully commercial product rollout within the next 18 months. Tessara has now launched a capital raise seeking up to $10 million to fund the commercial development of the RealBrain technology, as well as commence preparations for formal preclinical studies of the RealBrain Therapeutics for regenerative medicine. Neurological disorders are now the leading source of disability globally, and the ageing population is increasing the burden of neurodegenerative disorders. RealBrain can be manufactured at industrial scale via a robotic manufacturing process, making it easily adoptable, repeatable, and scalable. This new technology can help reduce costs, shorten research timing and improve outcomes of neuroscientific clinical trials that will have a real impact in patients and their families’ lives. Researchers at The Florey Institute are working to design implantable RealBrain micro-tissues for the treatment of Parkinson’s Disease and other neurological applications where cell or tissue replacement offers the potential of a cure. Further collaborations with aim to achieve fully automated, industrial-scale manufacturing of RealBrain models for use by contract research organisations and pharmaceutical companies worldwide. Tessara Therapeutics is one of the latest Tech23 companies,  and CEO Dr Christos Papadimitriou joined us on the Startup Daily show to discuss the capital raise, the story behind RealBrain and its potential to revolutionise the development of drugs that treat neurological diseases.

https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/funding/payto-fintech-hello-clever-raises-4-5-million-seed-round/|PayTo fintech Hello Clever raises $4.5 million Seed round|25/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Funding, Capital Raising, fintech, PayTo, seed capital|A buy-to-earn fintech Hello Clever has raised $4.5 million in a Seed round as it looks to build out its instant rewards ecosystem. The round was led by Vectr Fintech Partners with participation from CrossFund, Yolo Investments, Magnivia Ventures, Son Tech Ventures, Boson Ventures and notable angels such as Ken Cheung, the former APAC head of Facebook and Instagram, Daniel Johnson of Mercurien Insurance and Bosco Tan. The announcement came just days after Hello Clever became the first payment platform in Australia to offer PayTo pre-authorised payments, and on August 17, completed the first PayTo payment in Australia with the RBA. Launched in early 2022 by high school mates turned cofounders Caroline Tran and Gavin Nguyen, the pair are looking to use the capital to build a team of developers and designers as they also start to eye off other markets in the Asia Pacific region. Tran, the fintech’s CEO, said the platform is designed to support Aussie millennials and generation Z to track their income and spending, while using their own money to make payments as an alternative to credit-based buy now pay later services. “Hello Clever is the first Australian buy-to-earn platform designed with the customer in mind,” she said. “Through its real-time payment API, which is an instant payment solution powered by the New Payments Platform (NPP), PayTo and PayID, Hello Clever provides real-time cash back for customers and allows users to be clever with their spending, tracking it across multiple bank accounts in real-time.” The startup is at the forefront of the transformation of the Australian payments landscape with PayTo being introduced in July. It’s part of the NPP system and offers a new way for merchants and businesses to initiate real-time payments from their customers’ bank accounts.  Fast payments and rewards Hello Clever is designed to make fast payments (PayTo, PayID) possible for retailers and uses open banking, fast payments, and AI technologies to put together an end-to-end experience for younger consumers around shopping, payments, earning, and managing spending. “With PayTo, payments are now secured at bank level, meaning our customers can set up automatic payments from and receive rewards right into their own bank accounts. This allows us to focus more on building a comprehensive, friction-free spending and earning journey for our customers, while welcoming bigger merchants and enterprises across all verticals,” Tran said. “Imagine a platform where you can just checkout and earn cashback without even thinking about your cards or bank accounts, and at the same time you’re pretty sure your merchant will get your payment instantly and securely – that’s the kind of experience we’re building. Hello Clever allows merchants to unlock new customers from the fintech’s ecosystem and securely transact with reduced fraud and chargeback. As well as leading the way on that front, Tran and Nguyen are looking to ramp up the incentives for consumers to encourage them to embrace the shift to PayTo. “Achieving more than $4.5 million in seed funding allows us to grow and scale our product offering, ensuring we provide the support to as many users as possible to achieve their financial goals,” Tran said. Hello Clever now has more than 30,000 active users and built partnerships with 70-plus banks and more than 1,010 retailers including brands such  AMH Hair & Beauty, Skeyndor, The North Face, Under Armour, Lee Jeans, Timberland, and T2 Tea. Mark Munoz from Vectr Fintech Partners said they were immediately impressed with Tran’s vision “She was able to spot the open banking trend taking over the fintech space in the US and Europe and think of how to localise it to the Australian market through Hello Clever,” he said. CrossFund CEO Ben Cardarelli said they hadn’t seen another fintech app for millennials in the market with the same kind of traction and positive customer reviews. “We could tell Caroline was a force of nature and knew the industry inside-out,” he said. “We forecast Hello Clever being able to grow into Southeast Asia through Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam. These are all large markets with big, young, and tech-savvy populations that can benefit enormously from a payment solution like Hello Clever.”|no|
https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/funding/ex-qantas-execs-ai-based-blockchain-based-provenance-startup-bags-28-million/|Ex Qantas exec’s AI-based blockchain-based provenance startup bags $28 million|25/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Funding, blockchain, Capital Raising, supply chain|A former child slave who escaped civil war in Somalia for a new life in Australia, where she started out washing dishes for $5 an hour before going to become chief information officer at Qantas, has raised $28.3 million for her blockchain-based food supply chain startup. The round in Jamila Gordon’s Lumachain was led by US VC Bessemer Venture Partners as the business ramps up its US focus. Lumachain previously raised $3.5 million in 2019, in a round led by the CSIRO’s innovation fund, Main Sequence Ventures, having initially bootstrapped for 15 months. The idea began as a started as a dinner table conversation with friends in the meat processing industry and the lack of visibility in global meat supply chains, so there was  no way to connect an individual cut of meat back to the animal it came from. Gordon had built the Qantas spare parts tracking system, and decided she’d tackle this problem too, launching her startup in 2018. She looked at a range of tech as solutions, including DNA, RFID, and Isotope Analysis, but decided Computer Vision-based Artificial Intelligence (AI), combined with blockchain, smart devices and IoT was the best solution The startup offers transparency in global supply chains, tracking and trace the origin, location and condition of individual items in a supply chain, in real time, from farm to fork. Gordon believes that tracking incentivises farmers and manufacturers to create high-quality, ethically-produced products, as well as reducing waste and increasing efficiency to improve revenues and margins.Food waste is estimated to be a $1.5 trillion problem by 2050. Lumachain was part of Microsoft’s first scale-up program cohort and established a research partnership with CSIRO to develop a track and trace solution for abattoirs, co-funded through the CSIRO’s Kick Start grant program.    That focus on meat has seen the business sign up Andrews Meat, Coles and US giant Cargill to use Lumachain’s vision-based AI to manage food safety to traceability. The capital injection will be use to install that monitoring tech in US meat and processing plants.|no|
https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/funding/melbourne-edtech-raises-a3-3-million-to-help-schools-improve-student-performance-and-wellbeing/|Melbourne edtech raises $3.3 million to help schools improve student performance and wellbeing|24/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Funding, Capital Raising, EdTech, saas|Melbourne data analytics startup Intellischool has raised $3.3 million as it looks to go global with its edutech platform. The round was led by Sydney VC EVP and supported by social impact investor Save the Children Impact Investment Fund, edtech ventures Schoolbox and Curio Ventures, and personal backing from several edtech entrepreneurs. The capital is to bolster customer growth and for product enhancements amid ambitions to tackle primary and secondary schools in international markets. Intellischool’s SaaS platform takes data from multiple software sources to give teachers, school admin, students and parents insights that help student performance and wellbeing. Dave Philp and Josh Turci founded the startup in 2018. Philp said teachers can get frustrated and overwhelmed by having to switch between software systems so Intellischool was designed to surface insights within the existing solutions teachers use daily to offer “in the moment” insights to act on. “In my previous roles working with schools, I saw first-hand the frustration teachers experienced in making the most from their data,” he said. “Initial excitement for all new and exciting software was quickly displaced by confusion as valuable information sat across multiple siloed tools. Teachers and school staff were crying out for a way to make sense of all this unactionable data. Josh and I were very deliberate in building a solution that made simple and actionable insights a part of day-to-day learning and teaching.” A typical school tech stack can span more than a dozen software solutions, ranging from a Student Information System, to a Learning Management System (LMS), several digital curriculum providers, plus multiple learning, assessment and student wellbeing tools. Philp said that makes it difficult for information to synchronise between solutions to draw insights for student benefit. “It’s immensely gratifying to see how Intellischool’s product has become mission critical for teachers, students, and school administrators. For teachers, our software allows them to see student performance and identify at-risk students,” he said. “For the homeroom teacher, year level coordinators, and student mentors, automated and timely notifications have proved critical in facilitating check-ins with students, prompting out-of-cycle interventions and identifying which students may require priority attention. He added that giving principals and school administrators holistic data on student performance enables them to apply for needs-based funding and grants to service underperforming students.” “We’ve seen huge demand for our product since going live only two years ago. Schools need little convincing to come on board, and ultimately understand that our product improves student outcomes, teacher job satisfaction and overall school performance,” Philp said. EVP investment manager, Mark Velik said the edutech startup has strong traction in a notoriously difficult to access market, which demonstrates its inherent value. “Our discussions with Intellischool customers and prospects confirmed the deep emotional relief provided by Intellischool’s product and the seriousness of the problem to be tackled,” he said. “Initial offshore customers proved it was a global opportunity of scale for the business to address. In Dave and Josh we saw the perfect founders to tackle this huge task with their deep relevant experience in data and technology roles in schools.”|no|
https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/business/mr-yum-is-the-latest-startup-to-shed-jobs-cutting-17-of-its-roles-after-admitting-it-grew-too-quickly/|Mr Yum is the latest startup to shed jobs, cutting 17% of its roles after admitting it grew ‘too quickly’|24/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Business, Mr Yum, redundancies|The meteoric rise of restaurant ordering and payments platform Mr Yum has flamed out with the company announcing it will shed more than 40 jobs globally with CEO and cofounder Kim Teo admitting they “increased our headcount too quickly.” Less than nine months after raising $89 million in Australia’s third-largest Series A, led by US VC giant Tiger global, Teo told the Mr Yum team that they decided to shed around 17% of current staff “to extend our runway while capital markets remain uncertain”. All up, the software startup raised more than $100 million in just six months. In May, Mr Yum acquired fellow Melbourne startup MyGuestlist and its subsidiary CRM platform Sprout for an undisclosed price, taking the global team to 260 people, meaning around 45 jobs will go in the cutbacks. Teo shared “the heartbreaking news” more broadly on LinkedIn, saying the decision was “in line with a more focused strategy and structure to better support our customers, product vision and growth, while capital markets recover”. “Our team are so close, it will feel like a part of us is missing,” she wrote. “I’m so grateful for how our entire team have handled this today – with empathy, strength and camaraderie.” She offered to share an opt-in list of the people made redundant with other startups looking to recruit. In email to staff, Teo said they “completely accept and own” the rapid increase in headcount, and the decision to cut back was made “after deeply exploring every option available”. “We made an assumption that the strong economic environment would continue deeper into 2022; instead, conditions deteriorated rapidly in May, back when we first communicated the situation with you, and capital markets have remained soft since,” she wrote. “Every function will be impacted as we reduce roles that are no longer aligned with a more focused strategy towards our long term vision. We plan not to have to make headcount reductions again and to more forward with a more capital-efficient structure that supports our growth in all markets.” The company is giving redundant staff an additional six weeks of severance pay on top of the standard notice and accelerated stock option vesting to the startup’s next milestone, and 3 months of mental health support. “Please know this is in no way a reflection on your contributions to the company and our culture,” Teo wrote. Earlier this month Mr Yum was among nine tech companies chosen for LaunchVic’s 30×30 program, which is focused on building startups with a “unicorn” – $1 billion – valuation by 2030.|no|

https://www.startupdaily.net/partner-content/talent-retention/|“Don’t be rigid about flexibility”: 3 tech talent experts on how to keep your best people right now|23/8/2022|Mia Erickson|Partner Content, hr tech, human resources, people and culture, talent|Talent retention is becoming increasingly challenging in the current startup landscape. Startup Daily asked an Aussie unicorn, a rising fintech star and a modern HR platform how they’re tackling it head on. One of the hottest topics in the Australian and New Zealand startup ecosystem today is talent. Employee priorities have changed with The Great Resignation (or Reshuffle, as we’ve since come to see it). Teams are more dispersed than ever. Combine that with the pandemic talent shortage and the more recent market downturn, and you have a storm of reasons why great talent is getting harder to keep. But it’s not all doom and gloom. Startup Daily recently hosted a webinar, The Great Retain: How to keep your best talent right now, in partnership with HR platform HiBob, to see how the best of the best are keeping talent at this moment. Our panel included: Damien Andreasen, Country Manager of HiBob for Australia and New Zealand, one of the world’s fastest growing HR tech companies. The platform powers productivity, engagement and retention for modern and mid-sized businesses around the globe, and locally for businesses like Airtasker, Seer, PEXA and Novatti.  Anna Wenngren, Chief People Officer at SafetyCulture, a global technology company valued at $2.2 billion AUD in 2021. Since Anna joined in March 2020, SafetyCulture has grown from 300 to 700 people, and has achieved ‘Best Place to Work’ recognition across four continents. Lucy Chisholm is the HR Lead of Zeller, an Australian financial services and payments technology business. Zeller’s team has grown by more than 100 employees in the last 12 months. They shared valuable insights around employee engagement, company culture and initiatives and incentives that are driving loyalty. Read highlights below, or watch the full webinar here – sign-up is free:  Transparency during uncertain times According to Damien, companies are doubling down and looking at their strategies a little closer. One of the biggest concerns for any business and any employee at the moment is the stability of their role and their company. “No one really knows where the market is right now,” says Damien. “Maybe we’re all waiting for the second shoe to drop, but it feels to be a bit of a pause and a big holding of breath until we understand where it’s all going.” Lucy from Zeller says it’s been even more important now to be transparent during the interview process about where the company is at, because people are asking questions. “We have been really transparent with our existing team and anyone coming in,” she says. “They can see we are full steam ahead, but we’re also really cognisant there are pressures in the market and we’re talking to people about them.” When it comes to holding onto great tech talent, Lucy says one of the most common blindspots for founders and leaders is only hiring for skill set.  “We’ve had great success when we hire for say 80 per cent of the skill set, and then we really dig deep in what their attitude is like,” Lucy explains. “Do they have an awesome attitude and a growth mindset?” Anna from SafetyCulture adds that the companies with retention issues normally stem from a lack of transparency across the team. “The more that you can be transparent with talent about what’s actually going on in the organisation before they’ve joined, it really lets them come in with eyes wide open about problems to solve,” she says. “It’s really important if you’re going to retain great people, then all of the things that you profess to be as a business and the values you put on your wall, you’ve really got to live and breathe all of those things and make sure that there’s a felt experience of it too.” Improving employee engagement With the globalised nature of the tech industry and hybrid working conditions, engagement has become just that bit more challenging with teams here, there and everywhere. According to the experts, the solution lies in a free flow of communication, and semi-regular retrospectives to realign on the vision and strategy. “You might be able to attract people with great big fat salaries, but when times get tough, they’re not the people that are gonna stick behind the business and help you get through those more difficult times,” warns Anna. Taking a leaf out of his own book, Damien attributes the teams’ positive engagement at HiBob to the platform itself. “I was onboarded remotely a year ago – 80 per cent of my team that I built here were onboarded remotely. And we use Bob [the HRIS – or HR tech platform] as a central place to come together,” Damien says. The platform is used by HR professionals and managers working with modern and mid-sized organisations more seamlessly and productively. It has features specifically for milestone recognition, as well as pooling workflow, payroll, timesheets, performance management and real-time analytics into one place. “It puts some of the control back into the hands of the employees who want to feel engaged,” Damien explains. At Zeller, learning and development is a key area for driving employee engagement. In the last 12 months, Zeller has introduced an allowance for each to explore an area of their professional development. “The team member says, ‘This is what I’d like to explore a little more and learn more about’,” says Lucy. “And then the leader and myself will come in and support them where we need to.” Making connections meaningful and value-driven With staff reconsidering why they get up each day to work and how they want to do it, the role of business values can’t be underestimated. These days, it’s not just about the transactional conversation of salary – emerging employees are looking for purpose. “It’s about being connected to the mission of the outcomes and showing that people are still achieving goals they have and feeling supported in the role as well,” Damien says. He adds: “We’re talking more about bringing authentic self to work and if that’s the case… then there is going to be the blend between professional and personal. So supporting those two aspects and making sure that everyone has real connections, I think is a real key.” With more people returning to the office, Lucy encourages companies like her own to still offer flexibility and balance with working from home. “We’re pretty excited to see what we can achieve in person given what we’ve achieved working remotely,” she says. “We’ll just continue to listen to our team. We’ll ask them for feedback.” According to Anna, the focus on “partnership over policing” has been the biggest shift that she’s seen while working in Human Resources over the past 20 years. Like Zeller, SafetyCulture has recently invested in building a workspace that reflect the values and philosophy of the business. “We wanted to create a space that people actually wanted to be in that inspired creativity,” says Anna. “We’ve left it to the teams to work out what hybrid means for them and they know what they need to accomplish.” Something the panel can agree upon is that while hybrid working has introduced a sense of freedom for workers everywhere, it’s important not to get stuck in your comfort zone – as tempting as your Ugg Boots and tracksuit might be. As Anna puts it so eloquently: “Don’t get rigid about flexibility.” Watch the full webinar further up this page or at The Great Retain: How to keep your best talent right now.

https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/cryptocurrency/the-albanese-government-is-finally-getting-cracking-on-crypto-regulation/|The Albanese government is finally getting cracking on crypto regulation|23/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Cryptocurrency, auspol, cryptocurrency, digital assets, regulation|The Albanese government is looking to map out Australia’s cryptocurrency landscape, taking a slower approach to digital asset regulation and reform than the former Morrison government. In a joint announcement on Monday by federal treasurer Jim Chalmers, Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones and competition, charities and treasury assistant minister Dr Andrew Leigh, they said “the first step in a reform agenda” for crypto will see Treasury prioritise ‘token mapping’ work for the remainder of this year to help identify how crypto assets and related services should be regulated. The aim is to identify notable gaps in the regulatory framework, progress work on a licensing framework, review innovative organisational structures, look at custody obligations for third party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards, the ministers said. “This hasn’t been done anywhere else in the world, so it will make Australia leaders in this work,” they said “With the increasingly widespread proliferation of crypto assets- to the extent that crypto advertisements can be seen plastered all over big sporting events – we need to make sure customers engaging with crypto are adequately informed and protected.” A public consultation paper on token mapping will be released soon. Chalmers accused the former government of “dabbling” in crypto asset regulation and prematurely jumping “straight to options without first understanding what was being regulated”. The Labor announcement comes 10 months after a report into digital asset regulation was handed down by a Senate Select Committee that looked into the space. Chaired by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, it  investigated issues such as regulation and consumer protection, the fintech terror of “debanking”, and the taxation of digital assets. The report made 12 recommendations that Senator Bragg said will drive opportunities for innovative businesses, protect consumers, and enhance Australia’s competitiveness, while also delivering a clear regulatory framework for the digital assets sector in Australia. Former treasurer Josh Frydenberg embraced the report last December, announcing plans to modernise the rules around digital wallets and BNPLs, as well as improving oversight and licencing around businesses that buy, sell or hold digital assets, in what he called the “most significant reforms to our payments system in 25 years” He outlined a timeline that would have seen consultation on establishing of a licencing framework for Digital Currency Exchanges, and on a custody or depository regime for businesses holding crypto assets, completed by now, but that has been put to one side as the government shifts the focus to token mapping. The new Treasurer and government say they’re now “ready to start consultation” with stakeholders on a framework for industry and regulators, which allows consumers to participate in the market while also better protecting them. “The aim will be to identify notable gaps in the regulatory framework, progress work on a licensing framework, review innovative organisational structures, look at custody obligations for third party custodians of crypto assets and provide additional consumer safeguards,” Chalmers said. Recent analysis by Roy Morgan found that more than 1.07 million Australians – 5% of the adult population – now own at least one cryptocurrency, and under 35s make up the majority of those investors (59%) – more than one-in-ten under 35s. More than two-thirds (69%, 742,000) of crypto investors are men. Get on with it Responses to the government’s announcement were mixed. Senator Bragg said the Labor government “is trying to create the impression that it is doing something when it is not”. “In the Senate report, I recommended regulating crypto through a market licensing system as well as token mapping. No choice is required. Both can be done,” he said. “Australia is in the midst of a race for consumer protection, capital attraction and innovation. The Albanese government is commissioning another review rather than responding to the Treasury consultation on crypto markets and custody. The Government should get on with the job of producing a draft bill rather than further reviewing. Our competitors are enhancing their regulatory systems while we establish endless reviews.” Caroline Bowler, CEO of crypto exchange BTC Markets said they were please by the Treasurer’s announcement on token mapping and consumer protections.  “This move recognises the significance of the digital asset infrastructure for the future of Australia, and we look forward to working alongside the Treasury Department towards creation of regulatory framework,” she said. “It also mirrors the calls of many of us in the industry who have been asking for proportional, appropriate regulation of our sector. We echo the position of the Treasury consultation paper in March of this year, which recognised that regulation needs to be centred on risk and remain technology neutral.” Bowler said BTC Markets submitted feedback to both last year’s cross-party Senate Committee and the recent Treasury consultation paper on licensing and custody requirements for the crypto industry.  “The Treasury consultation paper in March 2022 spoke of regulating according to risk. It recognised that crypto assets are distinct in character compared to traditional financial products,” she said “The issues of trust and information asymmetry may be mitigated using blockchain technology. As a result, any regulations need to be applied based on risk, and considered technology neutral in design. Token mapping is the foundational work to achieve this risk-based objective.” Bowler said there are additional benefits to token mapping too. “It will provide greater clarity to crypto investors; aide companies in developing their own blockchain-based innovations; provide guidance to digital currency exchanges; as well as assist regulators in shaping an appropriate regulatory regime,” she said. “It will also correctly position Australia in a leadership role globally on this issue.” Bigger issues Dr Dimitrios Salampasis, director of fintech at Swinburne University of Technology he hoped the token mapping will guide regulators in deciding how to intervene, but the government needs to get on with the job. “This is indeed a vital first step so as to ensure a harmonised understanding of the different utilisations and behavioural attributes of existing tokens,” he said. “However, this token mapping exercise does not really solve the bigger issues around the unregulated world of crypto and the way different quasi-DeFI mechanisms have been functioning with devastating results. Consumer protection is vital and it is very important to consider the various crypto-enabled financial instruments that are constantly being developed.” Dr Salampasis said a major aspect of the exercise should be consideration of cross-jurisdictional approaches, the retail and wholesale utilisation of various tokens, the integration of digital assets in the metaverse and the ethical and human-level dilemmas that are being raised. “This token mapping requires a holistic approach going beyond the regulatory and taxation aspects of crypto embracing complex and sensitive aspects incl. identity, personal data, human rights, etc,” he said. “This token mapping should be conducted in conjunction to work taking place in other jurisdictions and international organisations ensuring consistency, regulatory and taxation interoperability. “The government should leverage the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Australia as a Technology and Financial Centre and avoid further delays.”|no|

https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/global-tech/ai-weapons-robot-subs-silent-drones-military-tech-startup-anduril-lands-in-australia/|AI weapons, robot subs & silent drones: the military tech startup created by the Oculus founder lands in Australia|23/8/2022|Julia Scott-Stevenson|Global tech, contributor post, military, The Conversation|Earlier this month, posters started going up around Sydney advertising an event called “In the Ops Room, with Palmer Luckey”. Rather than an album launch or standup gig, this turned out to be a free talk given last week by the chief executive of a high-tech US defence company called Anduril. The company has set up an Australian arm, and Luckey is in town to entice “brilliant technologists in military engineering” to sign on. Anduril makes a software system called Lattice, an “autonomous sensemaking and command & control platform” with a strong surveillance focus which is used on the US–Mexico border. The company also produces flying drones and has a deal to produce three robotic submarines for Australia, with capabilities for surveillance, reconnaissance, and warfare. The PR splash is unusual from the normally secretive world of military technology. But Luckey’s talk opened a window onto the future as seen by a company “transforming US & allied military capabilities with advanced technology”. From Oculus to Anduril One of the posters advertising the Anduril talk in Sydney. Photo by Julia Scott-Stevenson Unlike most defence tech moguls, Luckey got his start in the world of immersive tech and gaming. While at college, the Anduril founder had a brief stint at a military-affiliated mixed reality research lab at the University of Southern California, then set up his own virtual reality headset company called Oculus VR. In 2014, at the age of 21, Luckey sold Oculus to Facebook for US$2 billion. In 2017 Luckey was fired by Facebook for reasons that were never made public. According to some reports, the issue was Luckey’s support for the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. Luckey’s next move, with backing from right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel’s Founder’s Fund, was to set up Anduril. Finding new markets Since Luckey’s departure, Facebook (now known as Meta) has broadened its efforts beyond the virtual and augmented reality market. A forthcoming “mixed reality” headset plays a key role in its plans for a metaverse being pitched to business and industry as well as consumers. We can see similar pivots from consumers to enterprise across the immersive tech industry. Magic Leap, makers of a much hyped mixed-reality headset, later imploded and re-emerged focusing on healthcare. Microsoft’s mixed-reality headset, the HoloLens, was initially seen at international film festivals. However, the HoloLens 2, released in 2019, was marketed solely to businesses. Then, in 2021, Microsoft won a ten-year, US$22 billion contract to provide the US Army with 120,000 head-mounted displays. Known as “Integrated Visual Augmentation Systems”, these headsets include a range of technologies such as thermal sensors, a heads-up display and machine learning for training situations. Fulfilling work? Speaking to the Sydney audience on Thursday, Luckey framed his own shift to defence not as one of economic necessity, but of personal fulfilment. He described saying “your job is worthless” to new recruits in social media companies making games or augmented reality filters. That kind of work is fun but ultimately meaningless, he says, whereas working for Anduril would be “professionally fulfilling, spiritually fulfilling, fiscally fulfilling”. Not all technology workers would agree that defence contracts are spiritually fulfilling. In 2018, Google employees revolted against Project Maven, an AI effort for the Pentagon. Staff at Microsoft and Unity have also expressed consternation over military involvement. ‘Billions of robots’ The first audience question on Thursday asked Luckey about the risks of autonomous AI – weapons run by software that can make its own decisions. Luckey said he was worried about the potential of autonomy to do “really spooky things”, but much more concerned about “very evil people using very basic AI”. He suggested there was no moral high ground in refusing to work on autonomous weapons, as the alternative was “less principled people” working on them. Luckey did say Anduril will always have a “human in the loop”: “[The software] is not making any life or death decisions without a person who’s directly responsible for that happening.” This may be current policy, but it seems at odds with Luckey’s vision of the future of war. Earlier in the evening, he painted a picture: You’re going to see much larger numbers of systems [in conflicts] … you can’t have, let’s say, billions of robots that are all acting together, if they all have to be individually piloted directly by a person, it’s just not going to work, so autonomy is going to be critical for that. Not everyone is as sanguine about the autonomous weapons arms race as Luckey. Thousands of scientists have pledged not to develop lethal autonomous weapons. Australian AI expert Toby Walsh, among others, has made the case that “the best time to ban such weapons is before they’re available”. Choose your future My own research has explored the potential of immersive media technologies to help us imagine pathways to a future we want to live in. Luckey seems to argue he wants the same: a use for these incredible technologies beyond augmented reality cat filters and “worthless” games. Unfortunately his vision of that future is in the zero-sum framing of an arms race, with surveillance and AI weapons at the core (and perhaps even “billions of robots acting together”). During Luckey’s talk, he mentioned that Anduril Australia is working on other projects beyond the robotic subs, but he couldn’t share what these were.

https://www.startupdaily.net/advice/business-strategy/an-expat-australian-wellsaid-labs-ceo-matt-hocking-shares-4-lessons-on-building-a-startup-in-the-us/|An expat Australian, WellSaid Labs CEO Matt Hocking, shares 4 lessons on building a startup in the US|19/8/2022|Matt Hocking|Business strategy, artificial intelligence, contributor post, Leadership, Silicon Valley|Growing a startup in any country takes a certain set of skills, but sometimes having a different perspective can be an advantage. When I founded my first software startup in the United States, I found that my Australian roots provided some unique insights. I’m currently co-founder and CEO of WellSaid Labs, the industry’s leader in AI voice for business who successfully went through a Series A last July and has more than 50 employees servicing thousands of customers. I am no stranger to building startups, having co-founded Ghostruck, an innovative marketplace that connected users with licensed professional movers and raised $3 million in venture funding. Prior to Ghostruck, I was an early team member specialising in product development and branding at startups like Chime and MeetMoi (acquired by Match). I’ve also ran my own consulting firm where I led various projects for Uber, WeWork, Microsoft, Docusign and T-Mobile. My degree is in Design and Technology from Western Sydney University. Here are the 4 biggest insights I found   You are not an island First and foremost, building a network is essential for any entrepreneur looking to build a successful business. Finding a strong incubator in your field can be a great place to start. Not only does it provide the business support (and funding) you need as a new company, it also connects you with a pool of high-quality job candidates.  It’s important to make sure that your values, as well as your business goals, align with the incubator. WellSaid CEO Matt Hocking For me, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence’s startup incubator program AI2 culture fit with what we were trying to build. As an Australian in America, you are an outsider so it’s important to be strategic and put yourself out there to connect with talented and inspiring people. For me, my time as an Entrepreneur in Residence at AI2 was incredibly helpful to meet the brightest talent from all over. The institute attracts people who are all driven to use AI for good.   US VCs want startups that solve real problems While much of the news out of Silicon Valley is about tech that sounds almost like science fiction, the reality is that investors want to find products with a demonstrated need in the market. That means innovations that have a practical application are extremely attractive – education, production, and customer engagement – are what enterprises want improved by technology. I’d say by nature we Australians tend to take a more capital efficient, conservative approach to business as opposed to the “grow at all costs” mentality that permeates many American companies. That appeals to VCs here in the States. VCs are looking for startups with a strong focus on team, quantifiable data, and technology that is tested and viable to make an impact. When it came time to raise a Series A round of funding a year ago, having a product that addresses real-world daily challenges made the value proposition clear. WellSaid Labs gives content creators a super easy way to scale their voice content production without sacrificing quality. Businesses recognise how voice builds brand loyalty and increases engagement.  Our customers choose us to make their educational videos for kids, corporate e-learning tutorials, online ads and within customer service centres.  It’s these kinds of practical use cases that have really resonated with VCs.   A down-to-Earth style builds fast rapport and trust When we think of the software startup scene in America, images of hyper-aggressive CEOs are all over the media. I prefer a more laidback communication style to quickly connect with a customer, coworker, or venture partner. I’ve found that being approachable and keeping the message simple worked best. It’s important to remember that AI is a very nuanced area, especially when speaking to new customers and investors, who may not be super technical.  I am always refining my message to explain how we do what we do and the issues around AI better and more clearly.   Mateship culture is an advantage WellSaid Labs is completely remote, attracting employees from across the country.  The company culture is one of diversity and inclusion which has been a real factor in WellSaid Labs success.  Regardless of where they come from, I approach each hire like someone I’d call a mate and that has served me well. Many Americans have told me they are surprised how easily we call one another mate in Australian culture. I see this as a compliment and a secret power. Mate means more than being a manager, more than a leader on a pitch. I care deeply about the people we bring on board and finding talent. Whether in Silicon Valley, Austin, Boston or here in Seattle it’s tough when you are small and starting out without the exposure a larger company would have. But we like to focus on trying to instil in each employee a sense of ownership, because we are all building this together. That makes people feel valued and gives them a clear path to a meaningful career, when they feel that way, they will give maximum effort to building a great organisation. I like to think we are building real businesses for real people.  Seattle ranked ninth in the Startup Genome’s annual global startup ecosystem rankings, up one position from its spot last year. The region also ranked second in North America in terms of ecosystem knowledge.|no|
https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/other-tech/events-platform-delegate-connect-rebrands-as-joyn-for-global-ambitions/|Events platform Delegate Connect rebrands as Joyn for global ambitions|19/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Other tech, rebranding|Hybrid events startup Delegate Connect has rebranded as Joyn as it rolls out its global expansion plans. The Melbourne startup, which connects conference delegates at virtual and hybrid events on any device, raised $10 million in a seed round nearly 12 months ago in order to go global Airtree Ventures led the raise with its largest seed cheque in the fund’s history, supported Skip Capital, TEN13, and others Cofounder and CEO Jordan Walsh said the rebranding comes at a pivotal time following a successful expansion into the US market. “Technology and support, engagement, content and continued learning. These are the pillars that define our new brand,” he said. “We’re on a mission to help organisations forge deep engagement by elevating knowledge, fostering belonging, and enabling access to relevant content anywhere, anytime – this initiative is just the beginning of us doubling down on that mission.” Joyn began life as an internal platform for Walsh and his cofounder Jacob Thomas, and for their technical production and events company, in order to deal with logistics such as registration, live streaming, and video-on-demand hosting for large scale events. It wasn’t long before the idea became a white-label solution for the world’s biggest organisations, associations, and event management companies. Over the past year, the business has more than doubled its headcount to above 100 people, opening a US base alongside offices in Melbourne, London and Norway. Walsh said it’s been a “truly humbling experience” to look back and see what the business has become in just a few years. “We owe our success to our clients and our teams, many of whom have been on this journey with us from day one,” he said. “We want to be the only software platform organisations need to deliver their events, webinars and recorded content. We are launching products over the coming months that help to foster belonging and increase year round engagement for our clients. “Our clients have been asking us to build this for a while now, and we are really excited to be launching these products shortly!”|no|
https://www.startupdaily.net/topic/funding/seven-backs-real-estate-media-baron-antony-catalano-in-100-million-proptech-play/|Seven backs real estate media baron Antony Catalano in $100 million proptech play|19/8/2022|Simon Thomsen|Funding, antony catalano, media, proptech, Venture Capital|Seven West Media’s venture capital arm has thrown its weight behind a new proptech startup consortium by former Domain boss Antony Catalano and investor Alex Waislitz targeting the real estate sector. View Media Group (VMG) is a real estate digital media and agent services business, involving B2C and B2B proptech platforms. They include The Today Business, Catalano’s own real estate services marketing and tech venture, the houseandlanddevelopments.com.au, which his son Jordan launched in 2018 with Tom Hywood, the son of former Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood, as well as a real estate media business Catalano backed in 2019. While the value of Seven West Ventures equity investment, in a mix of cash and media spend, was not disclosed, Catalano and Waislitz are also chipping in “substantial capital” as well as media services their own regional newspaper business Australian Community Media (ACM) to give VMG a total investment of more than $100 million. View Media Group (previously IMP) was created by the joint-venture firm 20 Cashews, half owned by Catalano with Waislitz’s private Thorney Investment Group and the publicly-listed Thorney Opportunities Ltd holding the other 50% Catalano said new venture brings together a group of businesses and industry experts to create “a true disruptor” in the rapidly evolving proptech sector, with a pipeline of startup investments ahead.  “VMG will form a global-first conglomerate of proptech assets including portals, ad tech, lead generation, lead management solutions, media planning and buying, AI services, data and connections all under the one roof,” he said.  “We have a series of exciting announcements we expect to be able to share with the industry over the coming weeks involving fast-growing tech startups.”  VMG will initially include a 72% stake in search portal realestateview.com.au (REV), with minority investments in market-leading AI and data business Propic and the utilities comparison and connection business Beevo.  Catalano and Waislitz tipped $6 million into Propic in a Series A in June last year. It’s an AI-based chatbot startup for agents and property managers to respond and communicate via automated conversational or text AI. The power of 7 Seven West Media CEO James Warburton said  Seven West Ventures backs businesses they can help grow through the media company’s range of TV, BVOD, digital and print (The West Australian) assets.  “VMG is an exciting investment for us. The combination of Seven West Media, Antony’s experience and the team he has assembled is a recipe for success,” he said. The deal sees Catalano take the fight up to his former employer, Fairfax, now Nine. Antony “The Cat” Catalano and billionaire Alex Waislitz bought ACM, from Nine for $115 million in 2019 following its merger with the former Fairfax newspaper business. Fairfax paid $3 billion for the titles back in 2007. The duo also have a substantial stake in regional TV broadcaster WIN, a Nine affiliate. A former journalist, Catalano has been a serial entrepreneur in the real estate space, having built Domain into a digital powerhouse in its early Fairfax days before departing to launch Metro Media Publishing. Coincidentally, Fairfax spent more than $100 million acquiring MMP over several years to 2015, and Catalano returned to run Domain to its $2.3 billion IPO in 2017. Now he’s focused of the potential in property once again, saying the investment and partnership with Seven West Media is a clear endorsement of VMG’s potential.  “This will help fast track our growth and acquisition plans. Seven West Media is the undisputed leader in television and BVOD across every region of  Australia. Add the dominance of West Australian Newspapers in WA and you have a business that reaches 91% of all Australians every month.  “The team we have put together at VMG represents decades of experience in the property industry. They are the best in their fields and are running very successful businesses in their own right. Our plan is to bring these businesses together to form a property ecosystem where each business will drive value to each other and offer customers an end-to-end experience. “We are deliberately taking a different VIEW of the market and we want the experience of  buying property to be seamless at all steps along the buying journey. Be that browsing,  searching, transacting, settling or moving in, our tools will help make this journey easier.”|no|
